# Delay Control System Simulation and Analysis

This module defines a DelayControlSystem class that simulates a control system with input delay. It includes methods for stepping through the simulation, resetting the system, implementing MRAC, SMC control, checking marginal stability, and calculating gain and phase margins.
Developed for educational and research purposes.
